<p>Six months ago, one of my co-workers (Matthew from Clearpath) enlightened
me to the existence of Viking metal. Since then I’d watched the occasional
viking metal youtube video for the lols, but was not further tempted.
However, a few weeks ago I went to an <strong>Abbath</strong> concert and the <strong>Bathory</strong>
logo had almost as much real estate on patches and T-shirts as <strong>Immortal</strong>,
so I
caved and listened to their entire discography. These are my thoughts on Bathory.</p>

<p>Bathory<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>’s discography can be split into four categories: the extreme
metal 80s, proto-Viking metal early 90s, generic thrash metal in the mid 90s, and
Quorthon’s (the lead singer) one man viking concept albums of the early 00s.
Of these periods, the extreme metal and the generic thrash metal albums
are totally skipable. The thrash metal albums were dated when they came
out; <strong>Pantera</strong> had already done it better. The lyrics from one song in this
period merely list political or religious ideologies ending with the y-sound.</p>

<p>I don’t like their extreme metal phase because of the lo-fi recording and
the drumming that is played too fast to land the hits on target. I’m mildly
anxious about calling their first 4 albums skipable, because the technical
things I don’t like are probably part of the attraction for fans of 80’s death metal.</p>

<p>The proto-Viking metal albums are what the band are most known for, and they
are worth a listen. The epic lyrics, the folk-style singing, and the
acoustic guitars all make for a (mostly) pleasant listening experience.
However, the albums are flawed. Quorthon was not a strong singer and often
ventures out of his range. The ballads are a little boring, and the songs
are often too verbose to let the melodies breath. The song <em>Hammerheart</em>
from <em>Twilight of the Gods</em> is a particularly egregious example. It’s a
‘‘cover’’ of Holst’s Jupiter with mismatched lyrics sung out of key. I don’t think I’ll be going back to these albums.</p>

<p>In the early 00s, Quorthon produced three albums alone under the Bathory
name. The first, <em>Destroyer of Worlds</em>, is an interesting mix of contemporary
influences. Some songs have guitar licks reminiscent of <strong>Frusciante</strong>, another
song sounds a lot like stoner metal. There’s a male rage-type thrash metal
song that would have fit right in on <em>Reinventing the Steel</em>, and Quorthon’s
rough vocals lend it an authenticity that make it a lot more tolerable than
Pantera. Although I like this album, there are a few obvious flaws, the
largest being that Quorthon needed to step away from the sound effect
machine<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. I wasn’t expecting a hockey arena organ in metal.</p>

<p>Quorthon’s next two albums, <em>Nordland I</em> and <em>II</em>, revisit viking metal and are
better this time around: the lyrics mesh with the rhythm, the melodies have
space to shine, and the ballads don’t get boring. Quorthon even makes
synthetic horns pleasant, which I thought was impossible. My favourite
Bathory song, <em>Vinterbolt</em>, is off of <em>Nordland I</em>:</p>

<p><a href="https://www

<p>In my opinion, Bathory, along with <strong>Gentle Giant</strong> and <strong>Van der Graaf
Generator</strong>, are examples of bands who didn’t quite have the technical chops
or creativity to perfect their pioneering ideas. Viking metal was a novel style
in the early 90s, but unfortunately a twenty year back catalog clouded my
first listen of Hammerheart.</p>

<p>Of the four styles in the Bathory discography, the Quorthon solo-albums at
the end of his career hold up the best against the test of time. He was
experimenting with the latest sounds at the time across multiple genres, and
seemed to be trying to fix issues from record to record. Quorthon planned
another two albums to his Nordland series but died young before they were completed, and that is a shame. He was just getting good.</p>

    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Countess Bathory is to Metal and Gothic Fantasy RPGs as Ada Lovelace is to computing: they are very interesting women who are not commonly known to the general public, but their story has been retold ad nauseum. Bathory’s song about Countess Bathory is one of the better exemplars, but surely the genres can find other lady serial killers to idolize. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Panzer Division Marduk used the same World War 2 bombing sound two years earlier; Quorthon should have known better. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
