Nomadic - Silent is filler


The Flesh Prevails


The female backing vocals on The Flesh Prevails are a little weak.


In Harvest Wombs, the changes between technical death metal and more melodic parts are very abrupt, especially on Enslaved Eternal Phenomenon.

Dreamless is great! Does not push a lot of boundaries, but the execution is good.

Wind for Wings on Dreamless is a great song - I especially like the female vocals that start off subtle and crescendo, except it has a terrible emo vocal part.

Reminds me of a less fun Fleshgod Apocalypse


"Les Silences" is a really odd track for the band. It's like *Jean Michel Jarre* dabbled in metalcore.

Lead singer has an interesting voice that borders on whiny. "Over and Over" is an example of a great song ruined by unnecessarily mournful singing.

They really show their sludge virtuosity on songs like *Worlds Apart*, despite the long intro with whiny singing.
“Love you to Death” is great!


It’s like a heavier Baroness

Sometimes takes too long to get to the point - like on **MF**, the change happens 1m44s into the songs.
