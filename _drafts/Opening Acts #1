Fallujah


Nomadic - Silent is filler


The Flesh Prevails


The female backing vocals on The Flesh Prevails are a little weak.


In Harvest Wombs, the changes between technical death metal and more melodic parts are very abrupt, especially on Enslaved Eternal Phenomenon.


Reminds me of a less fun Fleshgod Apocalypse




Pallbearer


Lead singer has an interesting voice that borders on whiny


“Love you to Death” is great!


It’s like a heavier Baroness
