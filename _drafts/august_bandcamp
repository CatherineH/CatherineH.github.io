IV - BADBADNOTGOOD
==================
[![IV - BADBADNOTGOOD](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2662282282_14.jpg)](https://badbadnotgoodil.bandcamp.com/album/iv)

Chompy's Paradise is devine. I love love love the new saxophonist. However, his tone is a little harsh.
Their sound continues to mature. The album evokes a Tarantino soundtrack. 
However, there are a few flaws. The organ on "Time Moves Slow" clashes with the vocal melody.

Monomania, Vision Crimes and Self-titled Split EPS - Child Bite
===============================================================

Sick and Subhuman starts off a little rough - echo on the vocal track? but the guitar solo halfway in and and the progression of the track is neat

On Monomania -
The melody on Wrong Flesh is annoying. It sounds really out of place along with the track because it is so simple and has no resolution. This is probably intentional.
The Nab Munch Is On has a similarly odd melody - it sounds like a mid-century musical with some dissonant chords and lyrics like something out of beat poetry.

the lyrics remind me of Frank Zappa

A lot of the songs only get good at the three minute mark, after they've repeated the same roughly recorded melody over and over again, then the song will sneak up on you.

On Vision Crimes -

The recording quality has decreased from Monomania.
Worship sounds the most punky of the bunch, but it's only simple punk singing for a short bit

Wriggle - Clipping.
