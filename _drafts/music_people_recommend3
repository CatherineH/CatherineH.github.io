Woods of Ypres


The Green Album - the songs are about relatable topics, but part of metal's appeal is that the songs are often about non-pop subjects.

i.e. Dirty Window of Opportunity has good advice, but not something I want to hear in a metal song. Kind of reminds me of Protest the Hero in that aspect.

The singing is often hard to listen to, for example, on "december in Windsor". It sounds like I'm listening to a mopey dude's diary.
