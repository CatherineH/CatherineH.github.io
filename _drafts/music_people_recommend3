Woods of Ypres


The Green Album - the songs are about relatable topics, but part of metal's appeal is that the songs are often about non-pop subjects.

i.e. Dirty Window of Opportunity has good advice, but not something I want to hear in a metal song. Kind of reminds me of Protest the Hero in that aspect.
