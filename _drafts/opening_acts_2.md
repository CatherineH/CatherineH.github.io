**Tony MacAlpine** opened for **Steve Vai**. 

*M.A.R.S.* has some good stuff, like the electric keyboard solos. However, it also has some of the worst aspects of New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands - the non-melodic chanting choruses. Really generic heavy metal.

The chopin interludes are like the skit segments on rap albums - they show off the personality of the artist but are skippable.

*CAB* is light jazz. If you’re into this sort of thing, you’ll love it, otherwise it will be annoying. The fake trumpets are ear-grating.

*Madness* is a great album; it’s like everything you want out of Steve Vai without as many gimmicks.

His singing is not annoying and nasally, which makes *Master of Paradise* skippable, despite some great guitar and keyboard solos.

Unfortunately his discography highlights a few problems with listening to 80's metal - the drumming on certain tracks, especially *Box Office Poison* off of *Freedom to Fly* can't quite keep up with the playing and is a bit too distracting. I think my modern ears are accustomed to things being tighter on album tracks.

Chromaticity is great - it has the 90s style of keyboard power metal like on *Images and Words*, though it came out in 2001, which meant that the sound was a bit dated when it came out. Especially *Avenger*.


Brain Tentacles

**Brian Tentacles** opened for **Gorguts**

On certain songs the saxophone works better as a metal instrument than others. It has a tendency to slow down the music, for example, *Gassed* sounds like an experimental captain beefheart song with a really grating and short repetitive melody that gets annoying quick, and seems to be attempting to exist purely on the oddness of the song. By contrast, *The Spoiler* and *Death Rules* work better because they let other instruments breath, or have a longer melody. *The Sadist* is another song where the boring saxophone line overpowers the song.


“Palantine” is just a skit

**Intronaut** also opened for **Gorguts**.

Intronaut is pretty good! It’s technical death metal with enough progression and melody that it keeps me interested.

However, like a lot of modern progressive bands, they go for overkill on the samples - such as *The Unlikely Event after landing*. An almost minute-long weird sample intro leads into an otherwise nice song. I wish these bands would cut their samples into interlude tracks, so they can be deleted. Believing that these sample interludes truly add to the artistry of the song is pretentious. Same thing on the end of *Sul Ponticello*. 

The soft, minor key harmonic singing on *Core Relations* off of *Valley of Smoke* reminds me of **Nechochwen**. However, the track also has two pianos playing a melody in a round that is slightly out of phase.
