**Tony MacAlpine** opened for **Steve Vai**. Like Vai, MacAlpine is a virtuoso guitarist who became famous in the 80s by playing for heavy metal bands. Unlike Vai, MacAlpine's early musical influences were classical piano rather than popular rock music. MacAlpine's music is more technical and less gimmicky than Vai's as a result. Electronic keyboard covers of Chopin crop up several times in his albums, but are included as an expression of admiration rather than as schtick, like *E.L.P.*'s Hammond organ covers of Mussorsky. Having now heard both discographies, I prefer MacAlpine to Vai. 

MacAlpine dabbled in several musical groups throughout his discography, and a lot of it is skipable. His time in the supergroup **M.A.R.S.** produced some great solos, but also exhibited the worst aspects of New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands. Similarly, his work in **CAB** is also great, but I'm not into light jazz. The fake trumpets, slow, funky rhythms and repetitive melodies are ear-grating. Also skip the albums where MacAlpine sings, such as *Master of Paradise*

I would highly recommend the albums *Edge of Insanity* (1986), *Madness* (1993), and *Chromaticity* (2001), which each consist of the best in metal composition trends and styles of the decade prior to their release date.

Brain Tentacles

**Brian Tentacles** opened for **Gorguts**, and are a death metal band with a baritone and bass saxophone. The saxophone works better as a metal instrument on certain songs than on others. It has a tendency to slow down the music, for example, *Gassed* and *The Sadist* sound like a **Captain Beefheart** songs with a grating and short repetitive melody. By contrast, *The Spoiler* and *Death Rules* work better because they let other instruments breath, or have a longer melody.

Despite the few misses, this band is really neat and fun both live and on their debut album. I'm hooked.

Intronaut

**Intronaut** also opened for **Gorguts**. They're a technical death metal in a more subdued folk-metal style like **Nechochwen** rather than the aggressive style used by **Between the Buried and Me** on *Colors* and *The Great Misdirect*. My only complaint with their style is that, like a lot of modern progressive bands, they go for overkill on the samples - such as *The Unlikely Event after landing*. An almost minute-long weird sample intro leads into an otherwise nice song. I wish these bands would cut their samples into interlude tracks, so they can be deleted. Believing that these sample interludes truly add to the song is pretentious.
