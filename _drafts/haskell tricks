The default version of Cabal in the ubuntu package manager is 1.23, and most packages require >= 1.24. If you get an error like:

```
The package 'glib' requires Cabal library version -any && >=1.24
but no suitable version is installed.
```

If you attempt to install grapefruit, you may run into the error:

```
rejecting: gtk-0.13.9 (conflict: requires pkg-config package gthread-2.0-any,
not found in the pkg-config database)
```
Check whether gtk is in pkg-config:
```
pkg-config --list-all | grep gtk
```
If there is nothing there, install gtk+2.0:

```
sudo apt-get install gtk+2.0
```

another error:
```
Probable cause: ‘getInstalledPackages’ is applied to too few arguments 
```
I don't remember how I got out of this one. Maybe using a later version of the package?

If you encounter:
```
runhaskell Setup.hs configure --ghc
Setup.hs: Encountered missing dependencies:
```
but your dependencies are available in **ghc-pkg list**, it's likely that you're installing 
the package system side but your dependencies are installed for only you. instead, run configure for you only:
```
runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user
``
