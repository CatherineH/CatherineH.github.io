don't install python-base, pyoo or uno modules. You will run into errors like this:

  File "C:\Python34\lib\site-packages\uno\__init__.py", line 4, in <module>
    from base import Element, Css, Payload, UnoBaseFeature, UnoBaseField
ImportError: No module named 'base

As far as I can tell, there is no active development by the OpenOffice people on this.

Instead - 

- download libreOffice. Make sure that the system architecture matches the system architecture of your version of python. i.e., if you have a 32 bit version of python, download the 32 bit version of libre office.
