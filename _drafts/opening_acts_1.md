Fallujah
========

San Francisco's **Fallujah** opened for **Between the Buried and Me**. *Fallujah* is progressive djenty metal crossed with **Aphex-Twin**. I don't like ambient music, but I like this.

Nomadic - Silent is filler


The Flesh Prevails

In *Harvest Wombs*, the changes between technical death metal and more melodic parts are very abrupt, especially on *Enslaved Eternal Phenomenon*.

*Dreamless* is great! Does not push a lot of boundaries, but the execution is good.

*Wind for Wings* on *Dreamless* is a great song - I especially like the female vocals that start off subtle and crescendo, except it has a terrible emo vocal part.

Reminds me of a less fun **Fleshgod Apocalypse**.


*Les Silences* is like **Jean Michel Jarre** dabbled in metalcore.

Pallbearer
==========

**Pallbearer** opened for **Baroness**.

Lead singer has an interesting voice that borders on whiny. *Over and Over* is an example of a great song ruined by unnecessarily mournful singing.

They really show their sludge virtuosity on songs like *Worlds Apart*, despite the long intro with whiny singing.

*Love you to Death* is great!

*Devoid Of Redemption* sounds very **Sleep**-like, but it's not weird or progressive enough to justify the repetitiveness.

Itâ€™s like a heavier **Baroness**.

Helen Money
===========

Helen Money is an experimental music metal-like cellist. She opened for **MAGMA**.

Sometimes takes too long to get to the point - like on *MF*, the change happens 1m44s into the songs.
