===============================

Some of the songs are a little too tame this time around. *The Way It Is* sounds like a reject from the **Beatles'** *Help*. The lyrics are too repetitive and the beat and melody is too happy.

For example, the titular song, **Desire's Magic Theater**

Arcana 13 - Danza Macabra

*Hell Behind You* is a great Heavy Metal song.
