set the project:

```
gcloud config set project my-project
```

deploy the project: (make sure to include a versions tag or gcloud will just pick a version number at random)

```
gcloud app deploy -v ch
```

You can then see your particular version using:

ch-dot-appname.appspot.com

deploy a project locally:

```
dev_appserver.py --port=9999 .
```

If you get the error:

```python
>>> import google.appengine
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named appengine
```

Add the installed library to the PYTHONPATH in your profile:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$HOME/installed/google-cloud-sdk/platform/google_appengine"
```
