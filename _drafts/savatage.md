Savatage are a Progressive Heavy Metal band from Tarpon Springs, Florida that have been active since the late 70s. The band's producer Paul O'Neill and founding member Jon Oliva later created **Trans-Siberian Orchestra**, everyone's favourite Christmas light show backing track. I recently listened through the band's entire discography, and since I'm not a fan of other 80s progressive metal acts like **Queensrÿche** or **Crimson Glory**, I was not expecting much.

Their first albums are progressive NWOBM. *Sirens* and *Power Of The Night* take the best elements of NWOBM: the guitar solos, the nerdy lyrical subject matter, and the fast rhythms, but combines it with progressive elements in the song composition and the power chords. 

*Fight for the Rock* is not a good album. The songs are generic, though there are a few interesting keyboard solos sprinkled throughout.

In 1987, Savatage began working with Paul O'Neill, and their style became more theatrical, especially on their 1989 album *Gutter Ballet*. *Streets: a Rock Opera* is exactly as dorky as you would imagine from the title. The story, about a homeless former rock star, is not particularly interesting, but the songs are delightfully dramatic. The lyrics are mostly sincere and melodramatic, except for a few incongruous lyrics that make me wonder if I'm missing out on some 80s drug slang. For example, the lyrics of the chorus on *Tonight He Grins Again* are:

```
I'm just looking for a friend
But no one seems to be around
Except this monkey that I've found
Still he is my only friend
And tonight he grins again
```

So... either monkey is smack or a homeless man adopted a monkey that was wandering around a modern city.

The voice acting on the introduction to certain tracks is terrible and distracting, but it's my favourite Savatage album.

The two albums that came after Cris Oliva's death aren't very good. The songs on *Handful of Rain* seem dated for the time. *This Isn't What We Meant* off of *Dead Winter Dead* is the only gem in the rough, since it captures the cheesy musical drama of the rock albums. *Poets and Madmen* and *The Wake of Magellan* are alright, but rely too often on a lazy songwriting element of monotone patter, and the lyrics are cliched.

Although I don't like Trans-Siberian Orchestra, Queensrÿche, or Crimson Glory, I really like Savatage. This was a pleasant surprise.
