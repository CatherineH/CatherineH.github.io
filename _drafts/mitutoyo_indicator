[Mitutoyo dial indicators](http://ecatalog.mitutoyo.com/Indicators-C1169.aspx) can measure small displacements down to micron levels. I use them to calibrate motors used in quantum optics experiments, where every micron is several femtoseconds in the life of a photon. Modifying the instructions and source code in this [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Interfacing-a-Digital-Micrometer-to-a-Microcontrol/) on communicating with the Mitutoyo communication protocol from arduino, I was able to use a teensy to automate this calibration process.

My modifications/improvements to the original instructable are:

- creating a PCB for the teensy
- handling units and sign
- adding a SCPI interface
- creating a python example script using [InstrumentKit](https://github.com/Galvant/InstrumentKit)

The code and Eagle files for this project are available on [github](https://github.com/CatherineH/teensy-mitutoyo-interface).

Electrical Inferface
====================

The electrical interface between the teensy and the Mitutoyo cable are relatively unchanged. I printed
