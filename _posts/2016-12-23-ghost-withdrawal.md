[A nameless Ghoul](http://loudwire.com/ghost-new-album-fall-2017/) predicts the release of a new Ghost album in the fall of 2017, which feels like ages away. Here are some heavy-metal albums I bought recently to relieve my cravings:  


Purson - Desire's Magic Theatre
===============================

**Purson** is a progish, psychadelic heavy-metal band. Their fantastic 2013 debut album *The Circle and the Blue Door* was critically acclaimed by many prog and metal blogs. They opened for Ghost in their 2015 show in Toronto, and sound like **Black Sabbath** crossed with **Coven**. 

*Desire's Magic Theater* (guess which drug this album is about) came out in 2016 and is much tamer in sound than *The Circle and the Blue Door*. *The Way It Is* sounds like a reject from the **Beatles'** *Help*. *Electric Landlady* starts out fantastic, but has a corny major key change in the chorus. 

Not quite Ghostly enough because the song and melodies are too repetitive and familiar. This album is a disappointment. 

Arcana 13 - Danza Macabra
=========================

**Arcana 13** is a talented Italian heavy metal band that combines the soundtracks of old horror movies with a early 00s alt-rock singing style. Their debut album, *Danza Macabra*, came out in March 2016.

Like Ghost, they employ a lot of dramatic unison playing in between heavy guitar solos, with deliciously occult lyrics. Unlike Ghost, they have a tendency to stick to only one style. Despite having killer hook melodies, songs like *Dread Ritual* tend to go on a little too long. The vocals are constantly distorted, and it would be nice if there was a change in tonality or style.

Not quite Ghostly enough because the singing sticks to only one, heavily distorted style, but great in their own right.

Khemmis - Hunted and Absolution
===============================

**Khemmis** is a doom/heavy metal rock band. *Hunted*, an album they released in October of 2016, shortly after 2015's *Absolution*, has been called one of the best of 2016 by many metalheads.

Most of their singing is operatic but distorted, like **Arcana 13**, with frequent growling sections, which is a nice balance. They also strike a good mix between atmospheric and melodic sections with heavier meat, like on the song *The Bereaved*. The production quality and technical ability on *Hunted* has improved over *Absolution*, and I look forward to further improvement. My only complaint with either of these albums certain songs, like *Antedeluvian*, and *Candlelight* are slightly too doom-y for my taste.
 
Not quite Ghostly enough because of the slower doom-y playing, but great in their own right.

Spellcaster - Night Rides the World
===================================

**Spellcaster** is a modern power/heavy band. Their latest album, *Night Hides the World*, was released in July of 2016, is full of Ghost-like theatrical melodies and complex songs that inspire a large range of emotions without edging into the campiness of most power metal. Their guitar and drumming style is NWOBHM-ish, but the singing style is like a late 00's pop-punk band.

Not quite Ghostly enough because of the constant near-power-metal speed, but great in their own right.
