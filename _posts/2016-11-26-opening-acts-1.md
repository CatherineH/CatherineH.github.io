This post covers some albums I purchased by bands I encountered as opening acts at concerts I've recently attended.


Fallujah
========

San Francisco's **Fallujah** opened for **Between the Buried and Me**. *Fallujah* is progressive djenty metal crossed with **Aphex-Twin**, which is refreshing mix. Their style oscillates between being an emo **Fleshgod Apocalypse** or what **Jean Michel Jarre**'s metalcore experiments might have sounded like.

So far I like this band a lot, but I have two complaints. The changes between technical death metal and melodic parts are very abrupt, especially on *Harvest Womb*'s *Enslaved Eternal Phenomenon*. Their ambiance verges on filler - such as *Nomadic EP's* *Silent*. I'm not sure if I can think of a situation appropriate for some of their songs - it's too mellow to be programming or exercising music, but too metal for an intimate party or reading in bed. Similarly, *Venom on the Blade* is another track that has a great first two minutes but becomes annoyingly lethargic by minute 5.

Fallujah is not the most progressive band, but they encorporate new sounds and their execution is competent. If you want some fresh-sounding technical, check them out.


Pallbearer
==========

**Pallbearer** opened for **Baroness**. Though classified as doom metal, the slowness of their playing reminds me more of stoner metal bands like **Sleep**, though with **Baroness**'s chords. They're good, but have neither the melodic or rhythmic complexity of **Sleep** nor the emotional breadth or depth of **Baroness*. The singing is overly mournful, such as on their cover of **Black Sabbath**'s *Over and Over*, or songs take way too long to get started, such as on *Sorrow and Extinction*'s *Foreigner*.

Still, tracks that don't have much singing are great. If you like **Baroness**, check them out.

Helen Money
===========

**Helen Money** is a cellist and composer who opened for **MAGMA**. Unlike the previous two bands, she shares nothing with the act she opened for, except for an appreciation of orchestral instruments. I would classify her as being in the category of metal-adjacent experimental musicians like **Chelsea Wolfe**. Her music would be the perfect soundtrack to a purposefully tonally jarring Sci-Fi movie like *Under the Skin* or *Melancholia*. Her music may not be something to mosh to, but it is great music for writing down your dreams to.
