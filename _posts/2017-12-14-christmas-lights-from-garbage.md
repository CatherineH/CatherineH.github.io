I have a dilemma: I don't want to buy stuff for holidays, but I also don't want to be the only house on my street without Christmas lights. So I made myself some Christmas lights from:

 - the leftover [5050 RGB LEDs](https://www.amazon.com/econoLED-Flexible-Multi-colors-Non-waterproof-Changing/dp/B006LW2NJM) from my [last PC build](https://twitter.com/femion/status/903655137230585856)
 - the 12 V DC power supply from my old wifi router
 - the leftover canvas from making a bike bag
 - a leftover dowel rod from making a bookcase

I made a model of an individual LED strip in Inkscape and experimented with a few designs. The one I ultimately chose was these snowflakes:

I chose this design because it had relatively few angles, which meant I could free-hand layout the LEDs without needing to project the design onto the fabric:

I soldered the 12V and Blue Grounds on each snowflake, and then hot-glued some of the longer wires down to the fabric:

This is the end result:
