I am grateful that [writing critiques of the music people recommend to me](http://catherineh.github.io/music/2016/05/17/music-people-recommend-to-me)
 has not discouraged new recommendations. I enjoy listening
  to everything once, so please continue to send me stuff! Here are my 
  thoughts on the recommendations Iâ€™ve listened to recently.

Sleep
=====

I introduced John to stoner/sludge metal band *High on Fire*, he 
returned the favor by digging through frontman Matt Pike's discography and 
introducing me to *Sleep*. *Sleep*'s sound is on the rougher and 
distorted side of sludge metal, sounding more like *Sourvein*'s latest 
than *High on Fire*. It makes sense, since *Sleep* was active a decade 
before its predecessor, but it is interesting that Pike went for a 
faster and less distorted sound with *High on Fire*, whereas other 
stoner metal bands have progressed to slower and more distorted sounds. 
Perhaps the popularity of bands like *Baroness* and *High on Fire* have 
led to a newfound appreciation to 90's stoner metal.

The first two albums, **Volume 1** and **Holy Mountain** have some good 
tracks, including my favourite, the gut punching and hypnotic
 **Dragonaut**, however, the real masterpiece of their discography is 
 **Dopesmoker**, a churning bible-themed epic about the genre's favourite
  substance. The track is occasionally repetitive, but there are 
  frequent fantastic guitar licks that keep the track/album interesting for over an hour.

Katatonia
=========

Several months ago Jeff sent me a link to the latest singles off of 
Swedish death metal now progressive rock band *Katatonia*'s latest album, 
**The Fall of Hearts**. Though I wasn't enamoured with the tracks, I 
decided to listen to the rest of their discography.

Their early 90s death metal albums, **Dance of December Souls** and 
**Brave Murder Day**, are listenable, but they're not as interesting as 
more contemporary bands in the same genre, who utilize a greater range of
 tempos and chords progressions. I would describe these albums as 
 chamber music played in a death metal style.
 
In the late 90s their style changed dramatically to more gothic, 
melancholy sounds with clean pop-like vocals. Renske's voice was not 
quite suited to this style on their first release after the change, 
**Discouraged Ones**, but his voice improved with time. The live 
versions of the songs off of **Discouraged Ones** on last year's 
**Sanctitude** are a great improvement. The consistency of style and 
quality was cemented on their follow up **Last Fair Deal Gone Down**. 

**Viva Emptiness** has several songs that annoy me - **Omerta** has an 
interesting style but no instrumental break or progression, the lyrics 
on **Criminals** make no sense and do not fit the intensity of the bass
 line. As the theme of the album is depression, perhaps these faults are
  intentional - a sufferer of depression is unlikely to feel a large 
  spectrum of emotions, and when they do it is unlikely to make sense in
   context. Intentional or not, it doesn't make for a pleasant listening 
   experience.   


On their most recent albums, **The Great Cold Distance**, **Night is the New Day**,
 and  **Dead End Kings**, *Katatonia* are the Alicia Keys of prog-metal:
  pleasant to listen to, but the singing is weak and the songs never go 
  anywhere. *Chelsea Wolfe* is an example of this slow, moody 
  metal-flavoured singing of this style that I find very captivating. 
By contrast, this sounds like some Nu-Metal band took an ambien.


The Moody Blues
===============

After confessing my love of 70s prog metal to my dad, he confessed that 
he'd been teased in his early 20s for liking *The Moody Blues*. I had 
listened to **The Magnificent Moodies** during my teenage Beatles-led 
British 60s pop music phase, so it hadn't occured to me that they were 
proggy. But their psychadelic, symphonic rock **Days of Future Passed** 
is sometimes considered the first prog album.

Their albums of the late 60s/early 70s combine the classical symphonic 
and movie soundtrack sounds that *ELP* and *Yes* were adapting with the 
soft harmonic singing over strings of folk acts like *Simon and Garfunkel*. 
Though the composition and technique on these albums are great, the lyrics aren't.
Some of their songs remind me of **Eve of Destruction** - the heaviness
 of the subject matter was assumed to carry the song. 

The highlight of their discography are the three albums released with 
former keyboardist Patrick Moraz, **Long Distance Voyager**, 
**The Present** and **The Other Side of Life**. These albums have, 
unsurprisingly, the great piano composition and emotional range reminiscent 
of a *Yes* album.  

However, after Moraz left, the quality fell steeply off as they chased modern 
synthpop styles in order to relive their early 80s success. It's more 
obviously synthetic and unpolished than the worst things *Asia* put out in the 90s.
Like Asia they also put out unlistenable Christmas songs. At least *Asia* had enough
 sense not to bother with techno.

My recommendation - everything between '68 and '86 is great, the rest is unlistenable.
